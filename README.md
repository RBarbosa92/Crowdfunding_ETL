# Crowdfunding_ETL
Project 2 

For this project We built an ETL pipeline using Pandas, PostgreSQL, and Python to extract, transform and load the data from an Excel File into a Database.
All of our database information can be found in the database folder, which includes pictures of our code running and the ERD sketch to show the relationships within the database, and our representation of the data model.

The switch to using the cloud when it comes to ETL is something that many companies are now doing. It has many benefits like on demand scalability. The process can easily scale up or down depending on the needs of the business. Another benefit of it is by distributing the work to different locations it can speed up processing time.
