# Crowdfunding_ETL
Project 2 

For this project We built an ETL pipeline using Pandas, PostgreSQL, and Python to extract, transform and load the data from an Excel File into a Database.
All of our database information can be found in the database folder, which includes pictures of our code running and the ERD sketch to show the relationships within the database, and our representation of the data model.
